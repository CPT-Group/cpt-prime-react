hey everyone it's The Eclectic Dev today we're going to look at how to debug within Visual Studio our Azure functions that use the more modern isolated worker model let's check it out all right the very first step to save ourselves some headache and frustration is to go ahead and get a little bit of housekeeping done before we start debugging the actual functions very first thing is with Visual Studio 2022 or any version you're using it's important to keep the IDE itself up to date now you usually have a little notification icon down in the bottom right hand corner that may tell you uh which versions are available but we also want to make sure that the Azure templates and uh tools are up to date as well if I go into the tools menu and down to Options under the projects and Solutions in the tree you can see Azure functions there's an option here to check for updates it'll tell you what's in installed but we can go ahead and press that and it says there are tool set and template updates available so let's go ahead and download and install that first and then we'll move on to the next step once the azer function tool sets are up to date it'll indicate as such we can close this dialog and let's go get the Azure core tools all right installing the Azure function core tools is a good idea for a comprehensive way to test now if you're strictly testing from the IDE you may not necessarily need these but if you're going to test from the command line which I will show you will need these uh it also unlocks some additional power the ability to use the funk or function commands like function start or Funk start Funk AIT uh the ability to create new templates like Funk new so it's a good idea to have this it also allows for uh supporting non. net function types local emulation of the full Azure functions menu so it's a good idea to install this now depending on the operating system you're on there'll be different ways for Windows which I'm on a PC I'm going to go ahead and install the MSI I can grab this package we'll go ahead and get this installed here all right so I've got the Azure function core tools ready to install go through and install this now one note about this particular package is it's a static version so if you want to update it in the future you'll have to add or remove this from the operating system and then update it so we'll finish just getting this installed and then we'll move on to the last piece of housekeeping uh before we get into the configuration excellent our installation is finished so we're ready with that now quick mention if you're using visual studio code you can also install this via npm globally so you can install the Azure function core Tools in that manner there's multiple ways that you can get these tools installed depending on the IDE you're using also we're going to need azerite now if you're using visual studio this is already built built in and installed with it if you were using visual studio code you would need to install this separately through mpm but to mention what azerite does it emulates Azure storage things like blobs cues and tables so that if we're using any of this you'll want that piece in place as well with Visual Studio we've got it out of the box so let's go over to visual studio and now take a look at our configuration in My Demo Azure function app here I have two different functions I've got one for an http trigger and I also have one for a timer trigger now again I mentioned this is using the new isolated worker model versus the older and soon Tobe Legacy in process model if you've recently converted over that can give you some troubles when you're trying to debug your Azure functions so make sure that you've made all the correct updates including the attributes uh especially inside if I go into the project file many of the packages have changed from the old web jobs to the new Azure functions worker sdks and Library uh that you'll need to include in there as well as the Azure functions version I'm also using the long-term support here of net 8 so I've got everything in working order and now it's time to look at the different configurations for debugging Azure functions directly within Visual Studio we want to focus on the launch settings. Json now not too many properties to look at here if we go each one the command line indicates that this is a project and it will be uh spun up debugging using the net run as opposed to the funk start which we'll look at through the command line in a little bit we've got the port set here so that for our HTP trigger we can call it via Local Host uh but initially it won't launch the browser that's not a required property but it's explicit there also environmental variables uh this is the Azure web job storage so this indicates to use azerite but the main one here we want to look at is this environmental variable functions work or runtime net isolated this is the real key one to ensure that we are indicating which of those models not the old in process but the new isolated worker model that we are using with this we should now be able to spin up and debug our Azure functions so let's go ahead and open those two files and put some break points we have our HTTP trigger that we can call as well as our function timer that right now is set to fire off every 5 minutes so we'll start by looking at the HP trigger and let's get this started up debugging so we can hit F5 to debug or we can go ahead and start it directly in the IDE just remember that if you have multiple name profiles within launch settings Json like this isolated worker model function if you had added multiple make sure to select the correct one we'll go back over start it up what this will do is bring up this command window right here and show us which Azure functions it has recognized within our application and we can see right away we've got the function HP trigger test as well as the timer trigger that has been recognized as well also it gives us an indication of the local host and the port that it's running on so that we can test our HP trigger the idea here is that we're trying to get SU successfully debugging our application so at this point again if you hit any errors you don't have the right SDK the right configuration you're going to know it at that point you can debug those problems and get it corrected so that we will be able to debug the application I'm going to go ahead and use that and just click on this function or this uh URL right here and away we go it has called directly into it now I could debug the application as needed so I could go into here uh debug along the lines figure out what it's saying it logs to the command line also it'll come up in the browser welcome to Azure functions because that's what this particular HTTP trigger does now let's go ahead and stop it for a second I'm going to go over to the timer trigger and show how that one works so we'll remove the break point here go over the timer trigger let's go over here and use co-pilot to help us out I want to update this this KRON value let's say update to run let's say every uh 10 seconds because maybe I don't remember the exact uh Syntax for that so I'm going to go ahead and have it help me out here again not a requirement for running our Azure functions but just a little helpful for me here so I didn't have to go look that up this will run every 10 seconds now whether I need to debug The Constructor or the actual method itself so we'll go ahead and do that we'll go back over let's start this back up and the idea this time is that it should spin up and we should be able to debug within this timer trigger now what you may do with your settings is go ahead and knock those values down uh to a short value like I did so that you can debug it very quickly and there we go it's gone in we can debug our application just the same like we did before go through it and I've uh proceeded on and it's logged and it's running every 5 seconds so maybe I want to step through it with the execution and then we can continue on through multiple times so we've successfully debugged it locally using the IDE itself but I want to show you one additional way through the developer Powershell on how to debug these Azure functions as well so let's take a look at that using the Azure functions core tools that we installed earlier we can use those function or Funk commands to run our Azure functions and then we can attach the debugger to it as well not knowing every requirement or how things need to be run with your particular Azure function this gives you some flexibility note here as well that for the function commands we're about to run from the developer Powershell that it will use the local settings. Json file when we spin this up here locally and it has the important functions worker run time with the net isolated so this is a streamlined file but it has the important values that we need to run these commands so I have the developer Powershell open here although I could have a command window open separately and I'm going to issue a funk start do know that if you're running into troubles you can add the verbose at the end here which will give additional logging so what we should see here is a similar Behavior it's going to spin up and recognize which Azure functions we have tell us if there's any errors in this case we don't and once again you can see that we've got the HP trigger as well as the timer trigger now the thing about running it this way is we don't have debugging capabilities because we've run it outside of the IDE having the hooks into the debugger but what we do see is that they're running successfully because we can see the logger if needed what we can do is go up to the debug menu attach to process if you filter onnet not the funk. exe believe it or not but foret if you attach to that process now this runs every 10 seconds so here in just a matter of seconds there we've go we've got the debugger on it we can step into it or step through it check our values you know do whatever kind of troubleshooting that we need and that we're looking after and continue on of course this is going to run every 10 seconds but we've shown here that even with an external process using the Azure core function tools and the fun start I have the capability to attach a debugger if needed giving flexibility so if you need to stop that you can stop the individual debugger here within the IDE just remember down in the Powershell or command window that you have it will continue to run so you can hit contrl C to stop execution there as well so you have multiple ways for flexibility to either debug your Azure functions directly within visual studio and the IDE with the proper configuration or using external tools that may mirror your Cloud situation but yet still attach a debugger so that you have full capability to troubleshoot and debug all of your code anyway hope you found this useful if you did please give it a thumbs up check out the other videos on the channel and until next time this is The Eclectic Dev we'll see you later
